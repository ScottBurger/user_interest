# user_interest
Data and source code for calculating user interest decay rates

By taking in data in the form of:
date	game
7/18/2018	arboretum
7/18/2018	star wars rebellion
7/18/2018	el grande
...

We can see how interest in certain games decay over time, given some sort of decay function.
Each day of interest generates 1 point, and each day without interest decays by 5%.

An example walkthrough of this script can be found on my blog: https://svburger.com/2019/01/06/how-interested-in-this-thing-am-i-really/
